# 🖐️ Hand Sign Detection Using Python

This project is a real-time **hand sign detection system** built using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow**. It detects specific hand signs and converts them to text and speech output. The goal is to bridge communication gaps by translating hand gestures into understandable words.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time hand sign detection using webcam
- 🧠 Sign recognition powered by TensorFlow models
- 🎤 Voice output using text-to-speech
- ⚙️ Easy-to-run Python script
- 📦 Uses OpenCV + MediaPipe for hand tracking

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **MediaPipe** (for hand landmark detection)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **TensorFlow** (for model prediction)
- **pyttsx3 / gTTS** (for speech output)
